## Oveview

This file contains the all code needed to reproduce the result of the following manuscript:

**Autonomous Shaping of piRNA Repertoire by Adjacent Site Competition**

*Jie Yu, Natsuko Izumi, Yukihide Tomari, Keisuke Shoji*

## Requirement

To perform the code, **cutadapt, Bowtie, bedtools, samtools and R** are required.

There are four packages involved in all **`R`** code: **ggplot2, Biostrings, tidyr, and DECIPHER**.

## Note

Each code block is labeled with the running environment (**`bash`** or **`R`**) in **bold font** before it. ***Italics*** denote a suggestion to run on a server.

All results were saved in the same **`.RData`** file for picturing figures.
